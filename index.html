        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Battery Status API specification defines a means for web developers
        to programmatically determine the battery status of the hosting device.
        Without knowing the battery status of a device, a web developer must
        design the web application with an assumption of sufficient battery
        level for the task at hand. This means the battery of a device may
        exhaust faster than desired because web developers are unable to make
        decisions based on the battery status. Given knowledge of the battery
        status, web developers are able to craft web content and applications
        which are power-efficient, thereby leading to improved user experience.
        Authors should be aware, however, that a na√Øve implementation of this
        API can negatively affect the battery life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Battery Status API can be used to defer or scale back work when the
        device is not charging in or is low on battery. An archetype of an
        advanced web application, a web-based email client, may check the
        server for new email every few seconds if the device is charging, but
        do so less frequently if the device is not charging or is low on
        battery. Another example is a web-based word processor which could
        monitor the battery level and save changes before the battery runs out
        to prevent data loss.

        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single

      </p>
      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the

      <p>
        The API defined in this specification is used to determine the battery
        status of the hosting device.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent SHOULD not expose high precision readouts of battery
        status information as that can introduce a new fingerprinting vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY ask the user for battery status information access,
        or alternatively, enforce the user permission requirement in its
        private browsing modes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent SHOULD inform the user of the API use by scripts in an
        unobtrusive manner to aid transparency and to allow the user to revoke
        the API access.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user agent MAY obfuscate the exposed value in a way that authors
        cannot directly know if a hosting device has no battery, is charging or
        is exposing fake values.

      <p>
        The group is deeply indebted to Mounir Lamouri, Jonas Sicking, and the
        Mozilla WebAPI team in general for their invaluable feedback based on
        prototype implementations. Many thanks to the people behind the System
        Information API and Device Orientation Event specification for the
        initial inspiration. Also thanks to the nice folks bringing us the Page
        Visibility specification, which motivated the editor of this
        specification to write the introduction chapter discussing some
        real-world high value use cases that apply equally to this
        specification. Special thanks to all the participants of the Device
        APIs Working Group and others who have sent in substantial feedback and
        comments, and made the Web a better place for everyone by doing so.
        Finally, thanks to Lukasz Olejnik, Gunes Acar, Claude Castelluccia, and
        Claudia Diaz for the privacy analysis of the API.
